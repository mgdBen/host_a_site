    <h1> Hi Elliot! </h1> <!--Elliot is my son, I told him the website would say "Hi, Elliot" because he can read that sentence, so this stays. :)  -->
        <p>This website servers as part of my resume, demonstrating some of what I know. My actual resume is included at the bottom of the page.
        <br>Right now the website is running on an EC2 server running on linux. I got it live on 12/16/2020 and it was last edited on 12/17/2020.
        <br>Below is an image of the first version:
        <p>
                <img style="border:7px outset silver;" src = "/images/first-live-bby.png" alt = "This is a picture of the site's first content. There are three lines and they say: Hello Elliot! What'sup yo, I'm alive! Hello World? nah fam. HELLO INTERNET"/>
        </p>
        <br>It may not look like much, (not yet!) but I'm still proud of it. Gotta enjoy the small victories. I will continue to change and update the site as freqeuntly as possible.
        <h3>Next goals:</h3>
        <br>1 - Learn more about nginx config so I have a better unstanding of what's happening under the hood.
        <br>2 -<s> Take the site live at port 443 as well.</s>
        <br>3 - Incremental. Improve site design and content. Save all changes to this file and other site design files at a minimum to github. CSS for 2 columns next to help everything fit better.
        <br>4 - Display visitor's current IP address + New idea-display laste edited date on site without requiring a manual change.
        <br>5 - Get some non-html files working.
        <br>

<!-- "woo boy, you found the secret sentence. I'm not supposed to be here, don't tell anyone please." This sentence needs to stay somewhere in the backend forever as a fond memory of victory, when I finally accessed the site on port 80. -->
<!-- This next sentence is here because it was one of my original goals: ((Take a website live that says: "Haraa! I'm alive.")) So. -->
<!-- "Haraa! I'm alive." -->
<!-- Since I shared this with RG, if anyone is poking around and wants to try this for themselves you should!  -->

<!-- Digitial Ocean proved really helpful, although sometimes their setup required some exterior knowledge to work. -->
<!-- Mental note - Why does www.bhnresume.com work right now, but the server's local ip returns the default nginx config screen. -->
