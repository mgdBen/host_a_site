    <h1> Hi Elliot!!! </h1>
    <h3>What's up yo, I'm alive!</h3>
    <p>Hello World??? nah fam. HELLO INTERNET!</p>
        </p>This site is a running representation of how far I have come as an IT person. I was able to take it live at port 80 on December 12/16/2020. Screenshots of the first time it was live can be found here: <p>
        </p>https://i.imgur.com/8HA6osR.png<p>
        <p>I will continue to change and update the site as freqeuntly as possible, while working on things I enjoy and am trying to learn in my free time. Next goals:</p>
        <p>- Learn more about nginx config so I have a better unstanding of what's happening under the hood.</p>
        <p>- Take the site live at port 443 as well</p>
        <p>- Get some better style up here. This one will probably be incrementally and take some time</p>
        <p>- Display visitor's current IP address</p>
        <p>- get some none html files working as well</p>
        <p>This last sentence is something I want to test because I am curious. What would happen if this sentence is super duper long. Is it going to just go on forever or will it move to the next part of the page. I'm pretty sure it's just going to push on forever and >

<!-- woo boy, you found the secret sentence. I'm not supposed to be here, don't tell anyone please. -->
<!--This second sentence is something that I had as original goal. ((Which was Take a website live that says: "Haraa! I'm alive.")) So. The first sentence is something I wrote because I wanted there to be one hidden thing on the back of the site before it went live.  -->
<!-- "Haraa! I'm alive." -->
